Wifi Enabled Attendance App
In this project i specially tried to make an app to help the teachers of India so that they can take attendance of students when the students just turn on their wifi for a mere of few seconds, and the MAC adresses of all the students who were present in the class will be saved in our database, as simple as that.

But, there are are many issues in my code.
1)I didn't implemented a working database.
2)What about that student who is standing outside the class.
3)Security
