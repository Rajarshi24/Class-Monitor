# Class-Monitor
Wifi Enabled Attendance App  
In this project I exceptionally attempted to cause an application to help the teachers of India so they to can gauge participation of students when the students simply turn on their Wifi for a simple of few moments, and the MAC locations of the apparent multitude of students who were available in the class will be spared in our information base, as straightforward as that.

But, there are are many issues in my code.  
1) I didn't implemented a working database.  
2) What about that student who is standing outside the class.  
3) Security.  
4) Can you add some more days in this project.
